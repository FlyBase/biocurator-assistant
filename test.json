Local stimulation of APL in the lobes strongly reduced the baseline GCaMP6f signal in Kenyon cells locally, but also had a smaller widespread effect.

Again, this normalized inhibitory effect was spatially non-uniform, declining in strength with distance away from the APL stimulation site (Figure 7A4,B4). Strikingly, when stimulating APL in the horizontal lobe, odor-evoked Ca2+ influx in Kenyon cells was strongly inhibited in the lower vertical lobe, but less so in the tip of the vertical lobe (Figure 7A2,A4; difference between node 200 \u00b5m vs. 260 \u00b5m, p<0.01, paired t-test; see Supplementary file 2).

These results are best explained by leaky expression of P2X2 from the UAS-P2X2 transgene, either in Kenyon cells or projection neurons. In the negative control flies, the leaky P2X2 expression allows ATP to excite Kenyon cells in their dendrites, driving them to spike (hence ATP drives Ca2+ influx throughout Kenyon cell dendrites and axons). However, in APL>P2X2 flies, the simultaneous activation of APL by ATP is strong enough to suppress Kenyon cell spikes despite the local excitation from leaky P2X2. The fact that there is still local Ca2+ influx in the calyx despite local inhibition by APL can be explained by noting that both P2X2 channels and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are Ca2+-permeable. Thus, we detect Ca2+ entering directly through P2X2 or nAChRs in Kenyon cell dendrites (as opposed to through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels), but inhibition from APL shunts away the resulting depolarization and stops the Kenyon cells from spiking, explaining how local APL stimulation at Kenyon cell dendrites blocks both spontaneous and odor-evoked activity in Kenyon cell axons.

Still, GCaMP6f might not be sensitive enough to detect very low levels of Ca2+ influx. Therefore, to test whether APL releases GABA over a wider area than its area of GCaMP6f increase, we replaced APL stimulation with direct application of GABA (here, we drove GCaMP6f expression using OK107-GAL4, which drives expression in all Kenyon cells like mb247-LexA).

APL is thought to act through all-to-all feedback inhibition to sparsen and decorrelate population odor responses in Kenyon cells. Such a function assumes that each Kenyon cell inhibits all Kenyon cells via APL roughly equally and indeed, decorrelation should theoretically work better if all Kenyon cells inhibit each other than if each Kenyon cell inhibits only itself (see Appendix 1). However, if a Kenyon cell activates APL locally and APL is not evenly activated throughout, it may inhibit other Kenyon cells unevenly, that\u00a0is, some more than others. Such uneven lateral inhibition would depend both on how activity spreads within APL and on how APL-KC and KC-APL synapses are spatially arranged on APL neurites. In particular, if activity in APL decays with distance, activating Kenyon cell 1 (KC1) would inhibit another Kenyon cell (KC2) more strongly if KC1-APL synapses are close to APL-KC2 synapses (as measured along APL\u2019s neurites) than if they are far apart. Thus, the degree to which KC1 inhibits KC2 can be described by the weighted count of every pair of KC1-APL and APL-KC2 synapses (see Materials and methods), where the weight of each pair should fall off exponentially with the distance between the two synapses, given that cable theory predicts that signals decay as exp(-x/space constant) (; Figure 8G).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41797, "infons": {"file": "elife-56954-fig8-figsupp1.jpg", "id": "fig8s1", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_title_caption"}, "text": "Example Kenyon cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41819, "infons": {"file": "elife-56954-fig8-figsupp1.jpg", "id": "fig8s1", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Line drawings of example Kenyon cells of subtype \u03b3-m (A), \u03b3-t (B), \u03b3-d (C), \u03b1\u03b2-p (D), \u03b1\u03b2-s (E), \u03b1\u03b2-m (F), \u03b1\u03b2-c (G), \u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032-ap1 (H), \u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032-ap2 (I), \u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032-m (J) from the hemibrain connectome (v1.1). \u03b3-d and \u03b1\u03b2-d Kenyon cells receive primarily visual input from the ventral and dorsal accessory calyces, respectively.

In contrast, APL innervates the lobes continuously with numerous neurites that emerge in parallel from the calyx. In the hemibrain\u00a0connectome, these neurites average ~0.5 \u00b5m in diameter throughout APL; ~95% of neurite length is less than 1 \u00b5m in diameter and the maximum diameter is ~3 \u00b5m (Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 4). The narrowness of these neurites alone would predict that activity propagates poorly in APL compared to GGN. GGN\u2019s morphology actually more resembles Drosophila\u2019s larval APL, which has separate innervations of the lobes and calyx joined by a single process. The larval APL has pre-synapses only in the calyx, while adult APL has pre-synapses everywhere (Figure 8A). It is tempting to speculate that the locust and larval Drosophila mushroom bodies use global activity in APL/GGN to send feedback from Kenyon cell axons to Kenyon cell dendrites, whereas the adult Drosophila mushroom body uses local activity in APL to locally inhibit Kenyon cells everywhere.

This technique requires two caveats but we argue that neither substantially affects our conclusion that APL acts mostly locally. First, how spatially precise was ATP/GABA application? The co-ejected red dye indicator spread tens of microns from the ejection site (decay to half-strength\u00a0~10\u201325 \u00b5m; see Supplementary file 2). This spatial resolution is close to that of other techniques for local in vivo stimulation like two-photon optogenetic stimulation (decay to half-strength 12 \u00b5m horizontal, 24 \u00b5m axially). How precisely does the red dye indicate the spread of the bioactive compound (ATP/GABA)? This is difficult to answer with certainty, as it is unclear how much of the spread of dye/ATP/GABA arises from bulk flow from ejection from the pipette (which should affect dye, ATP and GABA equally) vs. diffusion (which depends on molecular weight and molecular volume). To the extent that ATP or GABA spread differently from the red dye, they are likely to spread farther, as they have lower molecular weights (dye: 1461; ATP: 507; GABA: 103), meaning that our stimulation is less spatially restricted than the dye suggests. Thus, our results likely overestimate, rather than underestimate, how far APL activity and APL\u2019s inhibitory effect spread from the stimulation site. If the space constant is indeed lower than our normalized estimate of 50 \u00b5m, then the imbalance between Kenyon cells inhibiting themselves vs. others is likely even more severe (compare \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a025 \u00b5m and 50 \u00b5m on Figure 8K\u2013M).

We accounted for leaky P2X2 expression by testing UAS-P2X2 only flies when imaging Kenyon cells, but not when imaging APL (as the same GAL4 driver controlled both GCaMP6f and P2X2). Neurons activated by leaky P2X2 expression could excite or inhibit APL (directly or indirectly). If they excite APL (as with Kenyon cells, which are indeed activated by ATP puffed on the calyx in UAS-P2X2 only flies), the ectopic activation should make us overestimate, rather than underestimate, the spread of APL activity (as in the previous paragraph). On the other hand, if ectopically activated neurons inhibit APL, restricted activity spread in APL might be explained by inhibition rather than APL\u2019s intrinsic properties. However, if this scenario were true, puffing ATP on UAS-P2X2 only flies would inhibit APL and thereby increase the activity of Kenyon cells. Contrary to this prediction, when we puffed ATP on the horizontal or vertical lobe of KC>GCaMP6f, UAS-P2X2 control flies, Kenyon cell activity was unaffected (Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2; presumably any leaky expression of P2X2 in Kenyon cells was too low for ATP applied to their axons to excite them).

At first glance, this observation is puzzling given the direction of action potential travel. GABA should act on Kenyon cells by suppressing depolarization through shunting inhibition in both dendrites and axons, as the GABAA receptor Rdl is expressed in both. Therefore, our observation of stronger proximal than distal inhibition appears to suggest that as action potentials travel from the axon initial segment toward the distal tip of the axon, they can enter a zone of shunting inhibition and be suppressed, yet recover on the other side. Such a scenario could occur if depolarization is suppressed enough to reduce voltage-gated Ca2+ influx in a local zone, yet remains sufficient on the other side of the inhibitory zone to trigger enough voltage-gated Na+ channels to regenerate the action potential. However, this interpretation seems unlikely. More likely, local inhibition might particularly suppress Ca2+ influx rather than depolarization, perhaps by acting through GABAB receptors; Kenyon cells express GABABR1 and GABABR2 and APL inhibits KCs partly via GABAB receptors, although their subcellular localization is unknown.

Local GABA application produces similar results to locally activating APL with ATP (Figure 7), suggesting that GCaMP6f signals in APL accurately predict GABA release. How can APL inhibit Kenyon cells where it itself is not active? Wider inhibition when inhibiting Kenyon cell dendrites (Figure 7C) can be easily explained as blocking action potentials, but the wider inhibition when inhibiting the axons is more puzzling. We speculate that this result might arise from wider network activity. For example, Kenyon cells form recurrent connections with DPM and dopaminergic neurons and form synapses and gap junctions on each other. Through such connections, an odor-activated Kenyon cell might excite a neighboring Kenyon cell\u2019s axon; the neighbor might passively spread activity both forward and backward or, not having fired and thus not being in a refractory period, it might even be excited enough to propagate an action potential back to the calyx. Alternatively, Kenyon cells indirectly excite antennal lobe neurons in a positive feedback loop. In these scenarios, locally puffing GABA or activating APL artificially in the vertical lobe tip would block the wider network activity, thus reducing Ca2+ influx in the calyx. Although the calyx was not activated when stimulating Kenyon cells in the vertical lobe tip in Figure 4B, this might be because simultaneous activation of all Kenyon cells (but not odor-evoked activation of\u00a0~10% of Kenyon cells) drives strong-enough local APL activation to block wider network activity. Future experiments may test these possibilities.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 68272, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "By combining our physiological measurements of localized activity with the detailed anatomy of the hemibrain connectome, we built a model that predicts that the average Kenyon cell inhibits itself more than it inhibits other individual Kenyon cells. This prediction is supported by previous experimental results that some Kenyon cells can inhibit some Kenyon cells more than others, and that an individual Kenyon cell can inhibit itself.

This finding is consistent with our findings in Figure 8, which predict only preferential, not exclusive, self-inhibition. For example, while blocking output from only \u03b3 Kenyon cells would remove \u03b3-to-\u03b3 inhibition, \u03b3 Kenyon cells (only 1/3 of all Kenyon cells) should still get enough lateral inhibition from the other 2/3 of Kenyon cells to suppress their activity to normal levels.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 69895, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We based our phenomenological model on the heuristic that depolarization decays exponentially with distance.

We ignored certain complicating factors in our model for simplicity \u2013 some due to lack of data (e.g. active conductances; differences in synaptic strength or membrane conductance across APL), others as simply beyond the scope of this study (e.g. dynamic effects of feedback inhibition; effects of neurite branching and differing branch lengths). Some of these neglected factors (e.g. active conducances) could explain why an unusually low ratio of  (0.025 m) is required to fit our experimental measurements of activity spread in APL.

First, local activity in APL leads to stronger inhibition of Kenyon cells nearby than far away, to the point that different compartments of the mushroom body lobes defined by dopaminergic and output neuron innervation can receive different inhibition. This local inhibition would allow the single APL neuron to function effectively as multiple inhibitory interneurons, much like mammalian and fly amacrine cells. Each \u2018sub-neuron\u2019 of APL could locally modulate the function of one mushroom body \u2018compartment\u2019, that\u00a0is, a unit of dopaminergic neurons/Kenyon cells / mushroom body output neurons. Different compartments are innervated by different dopaminergic neurons (e.g.\u00a0reward vs. punishment) and different mushroom body output neurons (e.g. avoid vs. approach), and they govern synaptic plasticity and hence learning by different rules (e.g. different speeds of learning/forgetting). Thus, APL could locally modulate different compartment-specific aspects of olfactory learning, especially given that different regions of APL respond differently to dopamine and electric shock punishment (Figure 1). If such local inhibition is important for learning, the fact that spatial attenuation of APL\u2019s inhibitory effect is gradual and incomplete could explain why mushroom body compartments are arranged in their particular order, with reward and punishment dopaminergic neurons segregated into the horizontal and vertical lobes, respectively. Under this scenario, APL would serve two distinct, spatially segregated functions: enforcing Kenyon cell sparse coding in the calyx, and modulating learning in the compartments of the lobes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 72769, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, the finding of disproportionate self-inhibition compared to other-inhibition provides a new perspective on APL\u2019s function. Inhibition from APL sparsens and decorrelates Kenyon cell odor responses to enhance learned odor discrimination but in general, decorrelation is better served by all-to-all lateral inhibition than by self-inhibition (see Appendix 1). Self-inhibition does help decorrelate population activity by pushing some neurons\u2019 activity below spiking threshold (Appendix 1); this could occur if APL can be activated by subthreshold activity in Kenyon cells, for\u00a0example, from KC-APL synapses in Kenyon cell dendrites. However, this effect of self-inhibition is better thought of, not as decorrelation per se, but rather as gain control, effectively equivalent to adjusting the threshold or gain of excitation according to the strength of stimulus. Of course, lateral inhibition is still a strong force in the mushroom body: given that there are\u00a0~2000 Kenyon cells, the sum total lateral inhibition that an individual Kenyon cell receives would still be stronger than its own self-inhibition, even with the imbalance predicted by Figure 8. Why might the predicted \u2018bonus\u2019 self-inhibition be useful? Beyond its role in sparse coding, APL inhibition is also thought to function as a gating mechanism to suppress olfactory learning; for such a function it would make sense for Kenyon cells to disproportionately inhibit themselves.

The self-inhibition panel is the same as the no-inhibition panel, just stretched vertically (i.e., self-inhibition acts as gain control), whereas the all-to-all inhibition panel expands the range of high cosine distances toward more similar stimulus pairs. Blank areas mean the activity is zero because excitation is below threshold, so cosine distance is undefined. (C) Generalization of (A,B) to population of 100 neurons. Stimulus 1 is sampled from a uniform distribution over (0, 1). Stimulus 2 is Stimulus 1 plus Gaussian noise (magnitude of noise governed by \u03c3; higher \u03c3 means the two stimuli are more different).

(E) Each curve is one column (one value of \u03c3) from the heat maps in (C) and (D), showing how cosine distance improves with lower coding levels.

In order to address this question the authors employ single cell mRNA sequencing as well as a battery of tests ranging from sensory stimulation via olfactory and electric shock pathways, genetically driven stimulation via TRP and PTX channels, and modeling work to demonstrate that neural activity is greatly reduced during propagation throughout the neuron, likely because of a deficit in ion channels required for active propagation of electrical potentials. The authors demonstrate how this decrement in signal amplitude and the reciprocal connectivity with the Kenyon cell population of the mushroom body results in the modulatory effects of the APL neuron on KCs becoming substantially localized. Modeling results suggest that, through the GABA-mediated feedback circuit this leads to KC activity from single neurons preferentially inhibiting similar KCs to a greater extent than dissimilar KCs, and to KCs preferentially inhibiting themselves more than any other KCs. This prediction has implications for mechanisms of sensory coding and learning in Drosophila, as well as for general appreciation of inhibitory mechanisms used by interneurons in neuronal networks.

Dendritic calcium in fly neurons can arise in large part from direct calcium influx through nAChRs, not necessarily from voltage-gated calcium channels, and thus need not reflect depolarization (Oertner et al., 2001). Both P2X2 and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are calcium-permeable (Lima and Miesenb\u00f6ck, 2005; Oertner et al., 2001), so we argue that the leaky expression of P2X2 (whether in KCs or PNs) caused calcium influx in KC dendrites directly through P2X2 channels (if leaky P2X2 is in KCs) or nAChRs (if leaky P2X2 is in PNs). In UAS-P2X2-only negative controls, the calcium influx (plus additional sodium influx) through these channels depolarizes the KCs enough to spike (thus causing calcium influx throughout KC axons). However, in APL>P2X2 flies, this depolarization is counteracted by GABA locally released from APL evoked by ATP stimulation, which opens GABAA receptors and thereby opens a chloride conductance, which shunts away the depolarization and pushes the Kenyon cell\u2019s membrane potential toward the reversal potential of chloride, which prevents the Kenyon cell from spiking.

In Figure 6 and Figure 7, calcium influx does not reflect depolarization triggered by a puff of ATP because the neuron being depolarized by ATP (APL) is not the neuron whose calcium influx is being imaged (KCs).

That is, why doesn\u2019t leaky P2X2 expression in KCs cause depolarization (and thus calcium influx) in KC axons? The answer is that the ATP puff locally activates APL, which releases GABA onto the KCs, which counteracts the depolarization in KCs caused by leaky P2X2 expression (but still allows calcium influx directly through nAChRs or P2X2), and prevents the KCs from firing action potentials, thus blocking depolarization (and calcium influx) in KC axons. This explanation is supported by the fact that in negative control (UAS-P2X2 only) flies, in the absence of ATP-induced inhibition from APL, the ATP puff does increase calcium influx throughout KC axons.
