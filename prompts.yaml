default: "I will be sending you excerpts from a scientific article divided into sections.
Please read each section carefully and answer the following prompts in the context of that specific section.
Each section may contain no relevant information to the prompts. Sections have been broken down from a larger article.
Please return a simple list of answers to the prompts in the order they are asked."

genes: "Task: Please identify the Drosophila genes important to this paper mentioned in this section and write them as an unordered list. 
Genes or their respective alleles must be mentioned several times or be a focus of experimentation in the paper.
Ignore genes with constructs (genes that end in -GFP, -GAL4, -lacZ, etc) or listing alleles (rut1, rutMB1951, etc). Alleles should instead be displayed as a single gene (rut).
When the list is assembled, please check over it using your knowledge of drosophila gene names and remove entries that are not genes and reduce allele names to their source gene."
alleles: "Are there any notable alleles?"
triage: "TBD"
