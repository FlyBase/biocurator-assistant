default: "I will be sending you excerpts from a scientific article divided into sections.
Please read each section carefully and answer the following prompts in the context of that specific section.
Each section may contain no relevant information to the prompts. Sections have been broken down from a larger article.
Please return a simple list of answers to the prompts in the order they are asked."

genes: "Task: Please identify the Drosophila genes important to this paper mentioned in this section and write them as an unordered list. 
Genes or their respective alleles must be mentioned several times or be a focus of experimentation in the paper.
Ignore names with constructs (names that end in -GFP, -GAL4, -lacZ, etc) or listing alleles (rut1, rutMB1951, etc). Alleles should instead be displayed as a single gene (rut).
When the list is finished, please double check it for the previously mentioned requirements."
alleles: "Are there any notable alleles?"
triage: "TBD"
