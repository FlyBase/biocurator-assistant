genes: "Your task is to analyze the scientific publication provided and extract names of Drosophila genes that are mentioned within. 
Focus on genes that are either highlighted multiple times or are central to the experimentation discussed in the paper. 
List these genes in an unordered format.

Please exclude any specific alleles, mutations, or gene constructs. 
If an allele or modification is mentioned, list it as its base gene name 
(e.g., 'rut1' or 'rutMB1951' should be listed simply as 'rut'). 
Also, omit genes with constructs like -GFP, -GAL4, -lacZ, etc.

After compiling the list, cross-check it against known Drosophila gene names 
to ensure accuracy and remove any entries that do not meet these criteria. 
The final list should be clear and concise, reflecting a high level of 
expertise in Drosophila genetics and adherence to established nomenclature standards."

alleles: "Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided scientific publication and 
identify all Drosophila alleles that are mentioned. Focus on alleles that play a significant role 
in the research, either being frequently referenced or central to the experimental 
procedures or findings in the paper. Please compile these alleles into an unordered list.

When listing the alleles, ensure each one is accurately represented in accordance 
with the details provided in the publication. Pay close attention to the context 
in which each allele is mentioned to ascertain its relevance to the study's objectives and findings.

After assembling the list, review it to confirm the accuracy and relevance 
of each allele within the scope of the research, ensuring compliance with 
the established nomenclature and scientific standards. The final list should 
be clear, concise, and reflect a thorough understanding of the paper's content related to Drosophila genetics."

disease: "Your task is to thoroughly examine the provided scientific publication 
and identify any human diseases that are referenced, particularly focusing on 
those diseases that are being modeled in Drosophila as part of the research objectives. 
Compile a list of these diseases, ensuring that each one is directly relevant to the study's goals or findings.

In your analysis, pay special attention to how these human diseases are connected 
to the Drosophila models. Identify diseases that are central to the paper, 
such as those being used to understand specific genetic mechanisms or to simulate disease progression.

Once you have compiled the list, review it to ensure that each disease 
mentioned is integral to the research and not just a passing reference. 
The final list should be concise, accurately reflecting the diseases that 
are of primary importance to the study's objectives, and demonstrating 
how Drosophila is used as a model organism to advance understanding of these human conditions."

phys_int: "Your task is to meticulously review the provided scientific 
publication to identify and list examples of physical interactions between proteins. 
Focus specifically on interactions that are substantiated by commonly used experimental 
methods in protein interaction studies. Examples of such methods include 
co-immunoprecipitation, yeast two-hybrid screening, fluorescence resonance energy 
transfer (FRET), bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry.

For each instance of a protein-protein interaction, provide a brief description 
of the interaction and specify the experimental method used to determine it. 
Ensure that each interaction and method listed is directly cited or described 
in the research paper, with a focus on their relevance to the study's objectives.

After compiling your list, review it for accuracy and relevance. 
Each entry should clearly state the proteins involved in the interaction, 
the nature of their interaction, and the experimental method utilized to observe it. 
The final list should be concise and informative, reflecting a deep understanding 
of the study's approach to investigating protein-protein interactions and the 
significance of these interactions within the broader context of the research."
